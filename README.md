# Lego-Scanner-and-Plotter
It can scan and recreate pixel art as well as read in pre-defined images from a file. 
The physical system consisted of a main frame made of Tetrix bars and a middle bar made of LEGO pieces that held the color sensor and marker. 
These components were controlled through a RobotC program loaded onto the LEGO EV3 brick.
The final product was able to scan low-quality, simple black and white pixel art. 
The smallest pixel size it can accurately read is 1/2 square inches, and the mechanism limits the overall size of the image to roughly 3 x 4 inches. 
However, the robot was able to draw at a higher resolution, with a pixel size of roughly 1/8 square inches, meaning that higher quality images can be produced from a preset than through the scan functionality.
